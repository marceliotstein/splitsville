  "changing": "<p>I often assume legal matters from other attorneys in which I am surprised to discover that my predecessor never took time to:</p><ul><li>Sit down with their client and listen to them for an hour or two to get the facts of their case in order to spot the legal issues which will likely be in dispute.</li><li>Explain how much the process will cost in terms of legal fees, expert fees (if necessary) and other &#8220;add-ons&#8221; that many lawyers forget to mention.</li><li>Explain the Laws of the State of New York as they relate to a particular topic.</li><li>Explain how the client should behave inside and outside of the courtroom.</li><li>Explain to the client what the realistic outcomes might be in the case.</li><li>Explain how we can achieve our goals in an ethical and legal manner.</li><li>Advise the client who will be working on their legal matter.</li></ul></p><p>Like a doctor that performs corrective surgery, I often am asked to assume legal matters from other attorneys midway through the divorce process.

  "children": "<p>One of the most troubling aspects of divorce is the effect it has on children. When conflicts take place, the most crucial aspect of matrimonial counsel is for everyone involved to understand that one parent may be acting in the children's best interests while the other is not. There are also times when a parent's instincts about how they wish to act may conflict with what is best for their children or their case.</p><p>As a lawyer who has prevailed in custody matters for both men and women alike, I counsel my clients carefully about how their actions and statements impact their children as well as how third parties perceive them within the context of a dispute involving custody, decision-making and parenting access.</p><p>While a less-involved lawyer may advise a client to \"just be yourself\", I educate my clients about a process that often involves attorneys for children, forensic evaluations, parent coordination and various education programs.  I do this before they embark on what is often a treacherous journey.</p><p>As an involved father, I remain steadfast in attempting to resolve these issues out of court but when faced with no viable alternative will not hesitate going to trial if the circumstances warrant it.</p>",

  "stakes":"<p>In order for your divorce lawyer to be an effective advocate, he must understand your business, whether it is run by you or your spouse. This is because in New York State, a business formed during the marriage is “marital property” subject to equitable, fair distribution. Over the last 17 years, I have litigated numerous cases involving the valuation and distribution of closely held businesses, including professional practices (e.g. medical, dental, law, accounting).</p><p>During many marriages, one party has obtained advanced degrees or obtained celebrity status, which is often called “enhanced earnings capacity”. This “enhanced earnings capacity” is often valued by a court-appointed expert to ascertain what it is worth as well as what portion was obtained during the marriage. Thereafter, unless an agreement is reached by the parties, the court will determine what portion of that asset the non-titled spouse is entitled to after trial.</p><p>I pride myself on being able to read and understand balance sheets and other financial statements. Income and assets are often obscured by “business expenses” that do not exist or are not reasonably necessary and material to conduct one’s business. Discovering these “financial shenanigans” are often key to understanding why one’s tax return is not a true indication of a party’s actual income.</p><p>I have also developed significant professional relationships with experts in finance and accountancy who I often call upon to assist me in properly representing high net worth clients and their spouses.</p><p>Confidentiality is crucial in every matrimonial matter. We handle your case in the strictest of confidence as we are mindful that your professional reputation is a crucial element in the success of your business and career.</p>",
