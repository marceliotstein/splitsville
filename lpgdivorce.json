  "approach": "<p>Your choice of a divorce lawyer is one of the most important decisions you are about to make. Many clients tell me from the outset of their divorce, “this is the fight of my life”. What I do in my law practice is convey to the client that we are going through this process together and that I am going to listen and advocate for their position.</p><p>When you come aboard with The Law Firm of Laurence P. Greenberg, you will be assisted not only by me but by a team of skilled lawyers who will work closely together to handle all aspects of your case, from personal family issues to financial and criminal investigations.</p><p>My availability is important to you. As your counsel, I will make myself available to you via telephone, text or email.",
  "changing": "<p>I often assume legal matters from other attorneys in which I am surprised to discover that my predecessor never took time to:</p><ul><li>Sit down with their client and listen to them for an hour or two to get the facts of their case in order to spot the legal issues which will likely be in dispute.</li><li>Explain how much the process will cost in terms of legal fees, expert fees (if necessary) and other &#8220;add-ons&#8221; that many lawyers forget to mention.</li><li>Explain the Laws of the State of New York as they relate to a particular topic.</li><li>Explain how the client should behave inside and outside of the courtroom.</li><li>Explain to the client what the realistic outcomes might be in the case.</li><li>Explain how we can achieve our goals in an ethical and legal manner.</li><li>Advise the client who will be working on their legal matter.</li></ul></p><p>Like a doctor that performs corrective surgery, I often am asked to assume legal matters from other attorneys midway through the divorce process. Changing counsel in divorce matters is common in New York State and can be as simple as signing a form called a &#8220;Consent to Change Attorney&#8221;.</p><p>If you are considering changing legal counsel it is crucial that you leave ample time for me to bring myself &#8220;up to speed&#8221; in your case, prior to trial, so that a change in legal counsel is worthwhile.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with &#8220;getting a second opinion&#8221; and if you are considering this, rest assured that your consultation with my office with remain in strictest of confidence.</p>",
  "children": "<p>One of the most difficult aspects of divorce is the effect it has on children. When issues of custody, decision-making and parenting access are in dispute, these “battles” are often time consuming and expensive. We recognize that there simply is no price that can be placed on the safety and welfare of our children. Children are our most valuable asset and protecting them is our top priority.</p><p>In deciding whether to aggressively litigate any custody dispute, I will carefully discuss the potential involvement of a child in such a dispute and what effect it may have on them, based on my years of experience.</p><p>In New York State, it is often common that when issues of custody, decision-making and parenting access cannot be resolved, the Court will often attempt to exhaust various remedies prior to proceeding to trial. These procedures include:</p><p>The court may direct the parties to attend “Parent Education” whereby they will take a course on how to deal with the affects of divorce on children and now not to involve children in the dispute.</p><p>The court may refer the parties to a court social worker who will endeavor to resolve the issue through mediation.</p><p>The court will often direct that each parent submit a proposed Parenting Plan with parenting access schedules and decision-making provisions in order to determine “how far apart” the parties are and whether some reasonable compromise is viable.</p>",
  "stakes":"<p>In order for your divorce lawyer to be an effective advocate, he must understand your business, whether it is run by you or your spouse. This is because in New York State, a business formed during the marriage is “marital property” subject to equitable, fair distribution. Over the last 17 years, I have litigated numerous cases involving the valuation and distribution of closely held businesses, including professional practices (e.g. medical, dental, law, accounting).</p><p>During many marriages, one party has obtained advanced degrees or obtained celebrity status, which is often called “enhanced earnings capacity”. This “enhanced earnings capacity” is often valued by a court-appointed expert to ascertain what it is worth as well as what portion was obtained during the marriage. Thereafter, unless an agreement is reached by the parties, the court will determine what portion of that asset the non-titled spouse is entitled to after trial.</p><p>I pride myself on being able to read and understand balance sheets and other financial statements. Income and assets are often obscured by “business expenses” that do not exist or are not reasonably necessary and material to conduct one’s business. Discovering these “financial shenanigans” are often key to understanding why one’s tax return is not a true indication of a party’s actual income.</p><p>I have also developed significant professional relationships with experts in finance and accountancy who I often call upon to assist me in properly representing high net worth clients and their spouses.</p><p>Confidentiality is crucial in every matrimonial matter. We handle your case in the strictest of confidence as we are mindful that your professional reputation is a crucial element in the success of your business and career.</p>",
