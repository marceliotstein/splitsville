  "approach": "<p>Your lawyer is an extension of you. When choosing your lawyer, you need to believe in his ability, knowledge and experience. You need to know that your lawyer has the ability to successfully communicate the reasons why you are entitled to what you want out of your divorce to the court, an adversary or an expert.

  "changing": "<p>I often assume legal matters from other attorneys in which I am surprised to discover that my predecessor never took time to:</p><ul><li>Sit down with their client and listen to them for an hour or two to get the facts of their case in order to spot the legal issues which will likely be in dispute.</li><li>Explain how much the process will cost in terms of legal fees, expert fees (if necessary) and other &#8220;add-ons&#8221; that many lawyers forget to mention.</li><li>Explain the Laws of the State of New York as they relate to a particular topic.</li><li>Explain how the client should behave inside and outside of the courtroom.</li><li>Explain to the client what the realistic outcomes might be in the case.</li><li>Explain how we can achieve our goals in an ethical and legal manner.</li><li>Advise the client who will be working on their legal matter.</li></ul></p><p>Like a doctor that performs corrective surgery, I often am asked to assume legal matters from other attorneys midway through the divorce process. Changing counsel in divorce matters is common in New York State and can be as simple as signing a form called a &#8220;Consent to Change Attorney&#8221;.</p><p>If you are considering changing legal counsel it is crucial that you leave ample time for me to bring myself &#8220;up to speed&#8221; in your case, prior to trial, so that a change in legal counsel is worthwhile.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with &#8220;getting a second opinion&#8221; and if you are considering this, rest assured that your consultation with my office with remain in strictest of confidence.</p>",
  "children": "<p>One of the most troubling aspects of divorce is the effect it has on children. When conflicts take place, the most crucial aspect of matrimonial counsel for everyone involved is to understand that while one parent may be acting in the children's best interests, the other may not. There are also times when a parent's instincts about how they wish to act may conflict with what is best for their children or their case.</p><p>As a lawyer who has prevailed in custody matters for both men and women alike, I counsel my clients carefully about how their actions and statements impact their children as well as how third parties perceive them within the context of a dispute involving custody, decision-making and parenting access.</p><p>While a less-involved lawyer may advise a client to \"just be yourself,\" I educate my clients about a process that often involves attorneys for children, forensic evaluations, parent coordination and various education programs.  I do this before they embark on what is often a treacherous journey.</p><p>As an involved father, I remain steadfast in attempting to resolve these issues out of court but, when faced with no viable alternative, will not hesitate going to trial if the circumstances warrant it.</p>",
  "stakes":"<p>In order to be effective, your divorce lawyer needs to understand your finances. This often requires absorbing large amounts of financial information quickly. As someone with a strong background in finance and accounting, I understand that tax returns often do not reflect a true financial picture. I also understand that that our firm needs to scrape beneath the surface as in New York State, the court is not bound by a parties' own account of their finances, nor should they be.</p><p>If your children go to private school, your spouse drives a Porsche, you have a house in the Hamptons and vacation in Saint Tropez, it is unlikely that your spouse earns less than a million dollars per year. Unfortunately, if you can’t prove that, you may be sadly disappointed in the results of your divorce case.</p><p>Aside from litigating what has recently been called the \"most complicated financial trial\" by an acting Supreme Court Justice in Manhattan, our law firm has achieved results that were previously believed to be impossible, including a disproportionate award of marital assets to one spouse due to the misconduct of the other.</p><p>We also understand that a divorce is an extremely emotional and personal process.  We want every client to know that whether you are a public figure or not, service and confidentiality are at the core of our representation.<p>",
